# ABSTRACT: Define things according to a specification, using hashes

=head1 ABSTRACT

This document describes DefHash, a specification for using hashes to define
things. DefHash was born out of several other projects/specifications like
L<Sah>, L<Rinci>, L<Riap>, L<Module::Patch>.


=head1 SPECIFICATION

In this document, hashes are written in JSON or pseudo-JSON (e.g. contains
ellipsis C<...> or JavaScript-style comments C<// ...>).

=head2 Definitions

B<defhash> is a regular hash, or dictionary, or associative array (or object, as
it is called in JavaScript). It has B<properties>, which normally translates to
the hash keypair. Property names normally translates to hash keys, property
values translates to hash values. "Normally" is used here because property can
have attributes:

 {
     "v": 1,
     "prop1": "value1",
     "prop2": ["value2", ...],
     "prop1.attr1": ...,
     "prop1.attr1.subattr1": ...,
     "prop1._extra1": ...,   // ignored
     "_extra2": ...,         // ignored
 }

The above defhash defines two properties: C<prop1> and C<prop2>. C<prop1> has
two attributes, C<attr1> and C<attr1.subattr1>. Hash keys which start with
underscore (C<_>) are ignored; this can be used to put extra information.
Likewise for attributes which starts with underscore.

Property names must follow this regex '\A[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\z' (an
alphanumeric-only word). Property attributes must follow this regex:
'\A[a-z][a-z0-9_]*([a-z][a-z0-9_]*)*\z' (a dotted alphanumeric word).

Property value can be anything. It can contain another defhash for defining
subentities, for example. In Rinci, a function metadata has a property called
C<args> to define function arguments; its value is a hash of argument names and
argument specification. Each argument specification is a defhash.

Property attributes can be used to store extra data into a property. Some
predefined attributes are:

=over 4

=item * alt

This attribute can be used to store alternate property values. The most common
are:

 alt.lang.<LANG_CODE>

Example:

 {
     "summary": "An English summary",
     "summary.alt.lang.id_ID": "Ringkasan dalam bahasa Indonesia",
 }

Another example (alternate value for different language, C<lang>, and different
environment, C<env>; the ordering should be asciibetical and a care should be
taken to not be ambiguous, since attribute names can only be words):

 {
     "default.lang": "en_US",
     "summary": "An English summary",
     "summary.alt.env_lang.web.id_ID":"(Summary in Indonesian, for web)",
     "summary.alt.env_lang.cmdline.id_ID":"(Summary in Indonesian, for cmdline)"
 }

=back

B<Specification> is a set of recognized properties and property attributes,
including whether the properties are required, expected values (schema) for
properties and attributes, and default values.

=head2 Why use hash?

 XXX allow us to evolve

 XXX data structure, supported by all high-level programming language natively,

 XXX being a data structure, ...

 XXX merging, unordered, ...


=head2 Common properties

These are the list of properties that all specifications must recognize:

=over 4

=item * B<v> => INT (default: 1)

Must not have attributes. This specifies the version of specification that the
defhash is following.

A specification can change over time. The C<v> property specifies the
specification version which the hash follows. Specification version is a
non-negative integer. If unspecified, it is assumed to be 1. But it can also be
0.

=item * B<defhash_v> => INT (default: 1)

Must not have attributes. This specifies the version of DefHash specification
itself. It is hoped that this should never change, so normally a defhash need
not specify this.

=item * B<summary> => TEXT

A short (< 72 character), one-line summary about the thing that is described.
For example, in Rinci function metadata, the C<summary> describes what the
function does:

 // metadata for function 'sum_array'
 {
     "summary": "Sum all the elements of an array numerically",
     ...
 }

=item * B<description> => TEXT

A longer description. Normally a paragraph or longer of text. The text is
assumed to be marked up in Markdown.

=item * B<tags> => ARRAY[TEXT]

A list of one or more tags, can be used to categorize the thing that is
described.

=item * B<default_lang> => TEXT (default: en_US)

Default language.


=head2 When should specification version be increased?

When a backward-incompatible change is introduced. This is defined to be removal
of a recognized property, or the semantic change of an existing property, or
other incompatible change. For example,

 XXX (modp 1->2, 2->3; ri ->2, not using defhash but that is not the real reason, removal of features property)
 XXX riap also bumped to 2 just because it uses hash
