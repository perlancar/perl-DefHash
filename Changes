1.0.13  2021-07-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium; Backward-Incompatible: yes

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - [removed] Remove support for "PROP(LANG)" syntax, to make DefHash
          rules simpler and more orthogonal. This must now be written as
          "PROP.alt.lang.LANG".

	- Change alt combination rule. Previously, when multiple alt subjects
          are specified, for example lang=id_ID and env=cmdline, it must be
          written as "PROP.alt.env_lang.cmdline.id_ID". It is now changed to
          either "PROP.alt.env.cmdline.lang.id_ID" or
          "PROP.alt.lang.id_ID.env.cmdline". Implementations are free to do a
          first-match when getting the property's value.

        [OTHERS]

        - Make it clear that uppercase letters are acceptable in
          property/attribute name. Tweak the regexes.

	- Mention implementations.
